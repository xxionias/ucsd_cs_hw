1. Compilation Error:
Assembling each assembly source file separately ...
gcc -c -g reverse.s
reverse.s: Assembler messages:
reverse.s: Error: unaligned opcodes detected in executable segment
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'reverse.o' failed
make: *** [reverse.o] Error 1

reverse.s:
Add a line on Line 15:
	.align	2
Reason:
Allocate space

2. Code Error:
reverse.s:
Add line 38:
	add	fp, sp, FP_OFFSET
Reason:
Manually set fp

3. Compilation Error:
gcc -c -g findEnd.s
findEnd.s: Assembler messages:
findEnd.s:60: Error: internal_relocation (type: OFFSET_IMM) not fixed up
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'findEnd.o' failed

findEnd.s:
Line 60 Before:
	str     r5, r1        	@ store ptr to last char
Change to:
	str     r5, [r1]        @ store ptr to last char
Reason:
store r5 to addr of r1

4. Code Error:
findEnd.s:
Line 57 Before:
	push    {fp, lr}                @ Prologue
Change to:
	push	{r4-r7, fp, lr}
Line 64 Before:
	pop     {fp, pc}                @ Return from function
Change to:
	pop	{r4-r7, fp, pc}
Line 15 Before:
	.equ    FP_OFFSET, 4   		@ (# of saved regs - 1) * 4
Change to:
	.equ    FP_OFFSET, 20   	@ (# of saved regs - 1) * 4
Reason:
Need to push registers

5. Output Error:
$ ./reverseString
You found 0 palindrome(s) 

main.c:
Line 30 Before:
 if (argc == 0) {
Change to:
 if (argc == 1) {
Reason:
argc includes execution

6. Code Error:
swapChars.s:
Line 64 Before:
         pop     {fp, lr}                @ Return from function
Change to:
         pop     {fp, pc}                @ Return from function
Reason:
pop lr instead of pc

7. Wrong Output:
$ ./reverseString potatoes
Before: potatoes
Illegal instruction

Use gdb:
Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
0x00010698 in findEnd () at findEnd.s:41
41		ldrb	r6, [r0]	@ Get 1st char of str

findEnd.s:
Line 13 Before:
	.skip	2
Change to:
	.align	2	
Reason:
Allocate space

8. Runtime Error:
$ ./reverseString potatoes
Before: potatoes
After: potatoes

You found 0 palindrome(s)

Change to line 51:
        add     r5, r0, -1      @ adjust str to point back to last char
Reason:
Will not execute this line.

reverse.s:
Change r3 to r7:
         mov     r7, r0                         
Reason:
r3 will change values after calling function.

9. Runtime Error:
reverse.s:
Add line 49:
	ldr	r6, [r6]
Reason:
Need to load the value of the addr.
